        By clicking a stat tile in the popup window it will toggle the label for the stat. So clicking [VPIP] will change it into [L:VPIP] and show "/VPIP: 12.3/" instead of "/ 12.3 /" on the overlay. 
    </p>
    <h3>Stat Categories:</h3>
    <p>
        Note that stats for each user are separated into three categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Heads Up (2 players)
        </li><li>
            Short Handed (3-6 players)
        </li><li>
            Full Ring (7+ players)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, if I am playing short handed then only stats from hands that were also short handed will be shown.
    </p>
	<h3>Hand Histories:</h3>
	<p>
		Hand histories are gathered by default and can be accessed from the popup via the data tab. Because of chrome limitations on the amount of storage an extension can use, hand histories are capped at 2000 hands. Once this limit is reached you will be notified by an alert and hand histories will stop recording until the hand history is cleared (also via the data tab). The recording of hand histories can be turned on and off with the checkbox under (you guessed it) the data tab of the popup.
	</p><p>
		Note: a full hand history has no impact on stat gathering. Stats will continue to be gathered even when the hand history is full.
